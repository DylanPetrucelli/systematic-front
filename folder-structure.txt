FOLDER STRUCTURE - GENERAL PURPOSE AND ORIENTATIONS FOR DEVELOPERS

- The src folder should be kept organized, as to make finding and altering files as easy as possible.

components: For components that are repeated throughout the application. These may be separated within different folders
such as ui, form, search.
A single component can have its own associated css, img or other files, and as such it should be contained within its own folder.

data: Should be used for different types of data files, such as the json that composes a section of text in a certain page.

global: Meant for elements that affect the entire application; the primary css and favicon, for example.

hooks: Used for react hooks that are repeated throughout the application. Like the components folder, may be separated internally.

pages: Has a folder for each page.
Within each page, there may be locally used components, which should be put in the page's subcomponents folder.

utils: Code utilities used in many places throughout the application, such as formatting functions
