FOLDER STRUCTURE - GENERAL PURPOSE AND ORIENTATIONS FOR DEVELOPERS

- The src folder should be kept organized, as to make finding and altering files as easy as possible.

components: For components that are repeated throughout the application. These may be separated within different folders
such as ui, form, search.
A single component can have its own associated css, img or other files, and as such it should be contained within its own folder.

data: Should be used for different types of data files, such as the json that composes a section of text in a certain page.

features: Meant for large (code-wise) features within the application. Elements should be put here if they have their own special
services, hooks, libraries, components, utils, etc. This is meant to make it so the other folders arent crowded.

global: Meant for elements that affect the entire application; the primary css and favicon, for example.

hooks: Used for react hooks that are repeated throughout the application. Like the components folder, may be separated internally.

pages: Has a folder for each page.
Within each page, there may be locally used components, which should be put in the page's subcomponents folder.

services: Encapsulation files for apis used within the application.
